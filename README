This application is a bridge between Logitech Media Server (LMS) /
SqueezeBox Server(SBS) and uPnP devices. It allows any uPNP device 
to be controlled as a normal SqueezeBox device.

in /bin, there are binaries for Windows and Linux (include how to run it on
32 bits and 64 bits versions) so rebuilding is not necessary, but if you 
want to rebuild, here is what should be done

This can be built for Linux or Windows. My main Windows environment is C++
builder, so i've not made a proper makefile. The Linux makefile is ugly and
very hardcoded.

Look in curent/ for a "stable" build. all other directory are wok in progress

===========================================================================
DEPENDENCIES
 - pthread (pthread_win32 on Windows) and dynamically linked
 - libupnp, statically linked

===========================================================================
LIBUPNP
 - Under Win32, libupnp is build with the following defines
        WIN32
        UPNP_STATIC_LIB
        UPNP_USE_BCBPP (for C++ builder)
 - Under Linux : N/A

 - The is a small bug in libupnp, so the file webserver.c, upnp.H and 
httpreadwrite.c must be taken from here, not from libupnp main repository, 
to rebuild the library

- TCP blocking *must* be disabled otherwise when a upnp player disappears
"non gracefully", it will block other communication for a long delay, creating
a "too many job" log in libupnp and all sort of nasty side effects. When 
launching ./configure, use --disable-blocking_tcp_connections (or 
--enable-blocking_tcp_connections). Sorry, the doc is a bit confusing on that 
topic. I choose to modify direcly the autoconfig.h in the root directory 
(and in build/inc) to make sure that the following was commented out 
	/* #define UPNP_ENABLE_BLOCKING_TCP_CONNECTIONS 1 */

- It is recommended to make the following changes to config.h (find the 
existing corresponding lines)
	#define MAX_JOBS_TOTAL 200 
	#define GENA_NOTIFICATION_SENDING_TIMEOUT 5
	#define GENA_NOTIFICATION_ANSWERING_TIMEOUT 5

===========================================================================
Main application for Windows
 - For compilation, use following defines
        WIN32
        UPNP_STATIC_LIB
        UPNP_USE_BCBPP (for C++ builder)
        NO_CODEC
 - Link with the generated libupnp static lib and ptrhead import lib
 - For runtime
        On C++ builder, requires cc32160mt.dll
        pthread.dll
===========================================================================
Main application for Linux
 - For compilation, use following defines
        NO_CODEC
        _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
 - Put the 3 libraries defined generated by libupnp in the Makefile directory
 - For runtime : N/A
