This can be built for Linux or Windows. My main Windows environment is C++
builder, so i've not made a proper makefile. The Linux makefile is ugly and
very hardcoded.

DEPENDENCIES
 - pthread (pthread_win32 on Windows) and dynamically linked
 - libupnp, statically linked

LIBUPNP
 - Under Win32, libupnp is build with the following defines
        WIN32
        UPNP_STATIC_LIB
        UPNP_USE_BCBPP
 - Under Linux : N/A

Main application for Windows
 - For compilation, use following defines
        WIN32
        UPNP_STATIC_LIB
        UPNP_USE_BCBPP
        NO_CODEC
 - Link with the generated libupnp static lib and ptrhead import lib
 - For runtime
        On C++ builder, requires CC32160mt.dll
        pthread.dll

Main application for Linux
 - For compilation, use following defines
        NO_CODEC
         _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
        _LARGE_FILE_SOURCE
 - Put the 3 libraries defined generated by libupnp in the Makefile directory
 - For runtime : N/A
