- Why does foobar fail on aiff?
	==> first, in preferences, it must be allowed to do HTTP seek as it GET the file, close the 
	connection, and do another GET bypassing the header. Second, it wants a file extension
	and seem to ignore content-type for aiff. Then, on aiff, it wants a content-length otherwise
	it claims the file is not seekable ... 

UNLIKELY
- enhance metadata management: add filesize (LMS won't give it)
- add matching pattern in config file to allow configuration by group
- add option to call an external program when upnp player is locked
