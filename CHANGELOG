0.2.5.0
 - in XMLFindAndParseService search ends if a service list is empty. It should end only when no service list remains
 - Set HasDigitalOut=0 in capabilities to prevent volume from being set to max and sent to player
 - in capabilities, ModelName is "squeeze2upnp"
 - Add coverart to UPnP metadata and <send_coverart> parameter to disable it 
 - Add duration to UPnP metadata
 - For wav and aiff, file size in header is now real and based on duration in all cases (including during repositioning)
 - When sending uncompressed using 'large file size", the HTTP size contains a real size base on duration if available
 - Remove a race condition where player did not have the time to buffer data when SetNextURI arrived late. Now give a queued 'nudge next'
 - Remove thread unsafe use of globals for on-the-fly wav and aiff header reconstruction
 - When using aac, content-type shall always be "audio/aac" even if ProtocolInfo has m4a (works with foobar, not yet with Sonos)

 - (P) correct profile nested structure overloading logic
 - (P) add option to disable coverart
 - (P) add a 30s surveillance timer to check that squeeze2upnp is still running
 - (C) it is not possible to differentiate a user stop from a end of track stop, so by default sq2u moves to the next track if any

0.2.4.0
 - add ARMv5 binary
 - When creating a UPnP renderer, set state(s) to STOP
 - Some players (moode) open the URL on SETURI, then close and re-open it on PLAY. But re-open might be received before close (due to threading), causing confusion with a double-open request. So use a mutex with timeout in sq_open
 - create a fake pthread_mutex_timedlock for OSX
 - Send SetPlayMode to NORMAL at each play (some players by default are in auto_repeat mode)
 - DLNA.ORG_OP set to 00 (limited random availability) 
 - cli_send_cmd must return NULL only if command is not responded, otherwise allow respond with an empty string

0.2.3.0
 - changing naming
 - cleaning LOG
 - AIFF problem is for all versions before 7.9
 - AIFF partial header' in not sent in LMS < 7.9 when transcoding happens, so try to detect source file format
 - aif removed from default codec list, too troublesome
 - fwrite for 24 bits pcm was not using adjusted buffer size
 - Support fully AIFF => build header on the fly
 - Use TrackURI from GetPositionInfo and not from GetMediaInfo - this is more reliable and saves one polling UPnP request 
 - by default, only use pcm in <raw_audio_format> because wav and aiff require a filesize and some players are stuck on the current URI when the whole size has not been received
 - Some players do not fill "TrackURI" so get it from "TrackMetaData"
 - add <log_limit> to limit the size of logfile
 - by default, codecs are <pcm,aif,flc,mp3>
 - Send a STOP to playing renderers at exit - critical otherwise libupnp does not stop (deadlock)
 - when checking codecs list, 'aif' was not in the matching list for 'aif' (only audio/L and wav)
 - In LMS 7.7, when sending pcm in AIFF format, there is an 8 bytes header to skip if the data is forwarded as PCM or WAV. Does not exist in 7.9 (don't know for 7.8)
 - Query LMS version at discovery do differentiate between different AIFF option
 - add option 2 to L24_format to truncate 24 bits in 16 bits for players that do only 16 bits (only for pm/aiff, not flac)
 - MainThread only sleeps 1 sec to speed up exit
 - optimize endianness changes

0.2.2.2 (not published)
 - XML special char were not properly handled in DIDL header ==> moved to a full XML constructor, not a sprintf patch
 - using autosave, only <device> sections are written unless there is no existing config file
 - removed memory leak in SaveConfig (nodelist using wrong free)
 - add the full channel and sample rate in DIDL header, not only in content-type
 - OSX version is now multi-architecture, named squeeze2upnp-osx-multi
 - Some players do not set "CurrentURI" properly in GetMediaInfo. Use the "CurrentURIMetaData" and parse it instead
 - Added partial AIFF support (not sending AIFF to player but accepting AIFF=PCM from LMS) ==> less byte-reordering needed
 - Codecs capabilities send to LMS only include codecs supported by UPnP player
 - added <raw_audio_format> as a comma-separated, ordered, list of file format sent to UPnP players amongst (pcm, aif, wav)
 - added <match_endianness> to try to match (within the priority of <raw_audio_format> byte orders between LMS and player to avoid CPU consuming byte re-ordering


0.2.2.1
 - mac_size in AddMR was wrong type causing a stack corruption on WinXP
 - version now works for XP and above

0.2.2.0
 - <buffer_dir> can be '?' (w/o the '') to enable use of default system "temp" dir (this is the default now instead of '.')
 - config parameters with incorrect values (buffer_size) no longer re-written with corrected values in config
 - config file generating (-i or 'save'  while running )do not erase existing players
 - add command line option '-Z' to disable interactive mode, allowing backgrounding using '&' in Linux (no more consumes 100% CPU)
 - buffer files are now deleted each time user stops a playback unless new parameter <keep_buffer_file> is set to 1
 - add <max_volume> parameter to scale and limit the <volume_curve>. Any value calculated from volume curve is scaled by <max_volume>/100
 - Window version is renamed squeeze2upnp-win
 - add -I command line option to auto-save config file at each scan
 - some players trigger false detection of URI change by reporting empty nextURI, so check the nextURI contains "-idx-" pattern
 - when saving an existing device, the UPnP friendly name was used, even if a different name was set in configuration
 - add -k option to force immediate exit on SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM
 - handle SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM properly

0.2.1.0
 - <upnp_scan_timeout> at 0 was not disabling scan
 - added <upnp_remove_count> parameter to remove a device only N times after failed re-discovery
 - add Ralphy's patch (SendARP) to compile for OSX
 - reset read pointer in sq_read by calling fseek

0.2.0.1
 - Race condition where a upnp poll-response can be interrupted by the update thread that removes that device - locking a non-existing mutex happens then
 - Handle 24 bits mono tracks with PACKED format
 - when <send_metadata> was disabled, some default metadata were not initialized (was missing backport from 0.1.4.0)
 - very quick pause/unpause created an infinite loop (created by fixing dealock issue between upnp notification and LMS playback in 0.2.0.0)
 - on quick unpause/pause, the pause command was ignored - can be irritating if unpause was pressed by mistake

0.2.0.0
 - each player uses own timer thread to poll position, track and related info instead of a single thread for all players
 - upnp rescan dedicated thread created at each scan interval to avoid blocking libupnp caller thread in callback
 - continue re-organizing LOG
 - metadata using "songinfo" CLI command to allow access to more information, includign albumart (still fallback to use "playlist" info if "songinfo" fails)
 - on <accept_next_uri> = 0, metadat was not properly handled, leading to random filesize being sent
 - add <upnp_scan_timeout> to configure how long a network player *rescan* lasts (initial scan is still 15)
 - <upnp_scan_interval> is 30 seconds minimum
 - When skipping track very quickly, a "playing" state of previous skip could be received before the "stopped" state or last skip, causing player to stall (confused with an unsollicited play)
 - force_volume was used, even when volume_on_play was set to -1 in SyncNotifyState
 - option -i was broken before a5 release
 - context index toggle shall be done after stream mutex lock (slimproto)
 - remove deadlock between upnp notification and LMS playback request (sq_notify call in SyncNotifyState)
 - global Mutex for renderer list un-necessary now that list is a table
 - change some string definition to allow VC2008 compilation
 - add the option to set a socket for upnp operations


0.1.4.0
 - <volume_on_play> can be set to -1 so that *all* LMS volume commands are ignored (use the player's volume control)
 - When pause/play directly on the player, action is feedback to LMS that should stay in sycn (still early phase ...). This does NOT work when "stop" is being used - such "stop" will be interpreted by LMS as an error and will move to next track
 - if uPnP player cannot play a format, send the proper error code to LMS (also send STMc everytime) == > that's to avoid being stuck in a middle of a playlist - LMS will gently move to the next song and a squeeze2upnp will just log the problem
 - add <flac_header> parameter
 - add <send_metadata> parameter
 - add <upnp_scan_interval> paramater (O to disable regular scan)
 - building a Linux statically linked version as well (-static)
 - <seek_after_pause> now 0,1 or 2 (2 restarts stream from that last sent byte - will stay undocumented as it does not seem to work)
 - add -4 for <stream_length> to allow usage of unkown file size to be sent *but* not using chunked-encoding (need updated libupnp webserver.c and httpreadwrite.c), responding to open-ended request (xxx-) by HTTP 206 and range xxx-yyy/*
 - add -1 for <stream_length> to allow usage of unkown file size to be sent *but* not using chunked-encoding (need updated libupnp webserver.c and httpreadwrite.c), responding to open-ended requests (xxx-) by HTTP 200 instead of 206
 - add -2 for <stream_length> to allow usage of chunked-encoding (need updated libupnp webserver.c and httpreadwrite.c), and responding to open-ended requests (xxx-) by HTTP 200 instead of 206
 - update DIDL-lite header to add DLNA namespace, <upnp:artist>, trackNumber and tweak other parameters
 - <mac> added to each device. As pointed by ralphy, current logic was not working properly. Now, if mac predecence is 1/ mac from <device>, then mac from ARP network request, then mac from <base_mac> + n (Nth player). when "save <filename> is called, the <mac> is re-written for every device. 
 - add command line "-i <config file>" to discover upnp players, save config file, then exit
 - add command line "-p <pidfile>" to store the pid
 - "unexpected" stops managed from squeelite side instead of uPnP (NB: a "stop" from the player"s remote will cause LMS to move to next track, NOT to stop
 - if <buffer_limit> is smaller than max(<streambuf_size>, <outputbuf_size>) * 4, set it to that max
 - <can_pause> parameter removed
 - big fat warning when config file has an error and cannot be loaded
 - improve HTTP range request response (might have impact with <buffer_limit> and pause reaction)
 - Update COMPATIBILITY file
 - remove all warning for Linux compilation
 - "cookie" is now a proper pointer, no more integer cast
 - configure libupnp with disabled blocking TCP connection and gen GENA timeouts to avoid "disapearing players" to lock the job queue, ending to a "too many jobs" disaster in libupnp
 - Stop sending poll request to a player that has generated more than 5 consecutives ACTION_ERROR (has disappeared probably)
 - for each player, check that <buffer_dir> is accessible in WRITE mode (and remove device if it is not)
 - Improved cleanup on exit() to avoid coredump 
 - Improved LMS device deletion when upnp device disappears 
 - When the same uPnP player disappears and re-apppears, re-connect was not working
 - Removed all memory leaks found by valgrind
 - metadata request can cause a fault if the list has been emptied (modulus 0 call)
 - when disabled, metadata gathering was causing fault. 
 - take into account metadata config as well when accept_nexturi is disable
 - sq_get_metadata must fill metadata in all cases, no NULL can be returned 
 - start to re-organize LOG levels
 - prepare metadata gathering for artwork and extended information (like filesize)
 - 64 bits int printed with %Ld for arm
 - divide by 0 on volume removed (was causing volume command 0 ==> 255)
 - volume calculation does not use float anymore (integer arithmetic only)
 - <volume_curve> ending pair changed so be (0x7fffffff,0x7f) to work with integer arithmetic
 - initialize a string in AddMRDevice


0.1.3.3 
 - with <seek_after_pause> set to 1, unpause was not restarting at the right time if repositionig was done during pause
 - when upnp device capability for pcm does not detail sample rate and channel (ie audio/L16), add the channel and rate details in the mime-type response (ie audio/L16;channels=2;rate=44100) - was need for foobar2000
 - add aac in the supported format (does not seem to work with Sonos or foobar yet)
 - <volume_on_play> to 1 by default
 - <volume_curve> max by default is 65536 instead of 65535
 - check that squeezelite instance was created before trying to run it
 - L/R inversion corrected in PCM 24 bits, packed type 1
 - buffer write file opening done as soon as LMS play command is received (quick GET)
 - in flac metadata (for repositionning) vorbis header is needed to NamUniti
 - flac header in re-positioning was not set as "last block = 0x80" (happened after vorbis_comment was removed)
 - handle case where no playlist index is returned in metadata (crash)
 - metadata track and time request were doubling the '?'
 - add metadata 
 - change incorrect upnp:artist to dc:creator in DIDL string
 - change back flac header re-insertion default max block size to 0xfff
 - remove a few compiler warning
 - improve the "synchronous start" (continuous synchro does not work)

0.1.2.0
 - add a wav header to pcm stream for players that accept audio/wav, audio/x-wav and audio/wave in protocol info by do not accept audio/Lxx (xx = sample size).Was needed for Sonos to receive pcm samples. Endianness pobably need more attention
 - re-organize format detection code for wave header addition
 - suppress DIRECT mode (was useless)
 - correct some coredump on exit (access to invalid file handles)
