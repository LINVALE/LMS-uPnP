<flac_header>[0 | 1 | 2]</flac_header>
When repositioning on a flac playback, LMS re-generates a file starting from the new position but does not insert a proper header . Such header is required by some players and it contains information like total number of samples in the file and a checksum of the decoded audio data. Sq2u cannot know these values and the flac standard specifies that they should then be set to 0. Nevertheless, some players consider these audio data as being a live stream and will consequently refuse to pause. The symptoms varies, but mainly after a re-positionning, pause/un-pause will fail or, if <seek_after_pause> is set to 1, the first pause/un-pause will work, but not any subsequent pause/un-pause
0 : no header re-inserted
1: header re-inserted with 0 for total number of sample and checksum
2: header re-inserted with 2^32-1 for total number of samples and 0xaa (170) 16 times for checksum


<send_metadata>[0 | 1]</meta_data>
0 : do not send metadata to player
1 : send metadata (title, artist, album, genre, duration) to player
====================================================================
0.1.4.0
 - metadata request can cause a fault if the list has been emptied (mod 0 call)
 - if uPnP player cannot play a format, send the proper error code to LMS (also send STMc everytime)
 - add <flac_header> parameter
 - add <send_metadata> parameter

0.1.3.3 
 - with <seek_after_pause> set to 1, unpause was not restarting at the right time
if repositionig was done during pause
 - when upnp device capability for pcm does not detail sample rate and channel 
(ie audio/L16), add the channel and rate details in the mime-type response 
(ie audio/L16;channels=2;rate=44100) - was need for foobar2000
 - add aac in the supported format (does not seem to work with Sonos or foobar yet)
 - <volume_on_play> to 1 by default
 - <volume_curve> max by default is 65536 instead of 65535
 - check that squeezelite instance was created before trying to run it
 - L/R inversion corrected in PCM 24 bits, packed type 1
 - buffer write file opening done as soon as LMS play command is received (quick GET)
 - in flac metadata (for repositionning) vorbis header is needed to NamUniti
 - flac header in re-positioning was not set as "last block = 0x80" (happened after 
vorbis_comment was removed)
 - handle case where no playlist index is returned in metadata (crash)
 - metadata track and time request were doubling the '?'
 - add metadata 
 - change incorrect upnp:artist to dc:creator in DIDL string
 - change back flac header re-insertion default max block size to 0xfff
 - remove a few compiler warning
 - improve the "synchronous start" (continuous synchro does not work)

0.1.2.0
 - add a wav header to pcm stream for players that accept audio/wav, audio/x-wav 
and audio/wave in protocol info by do not accept audio/Lxx (xx = sample size).
Was needed for Sonos to receive pcm samples. Endianness pobably need more attention
 - re-organize format detection code for wave header addition
 - suppress DIRECT mode (was useless)
 - correct some coredump on exit (access to invalid file handles)
