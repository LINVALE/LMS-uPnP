0.1.2.0
 - add a wav header to pcm stream for players that accept audio/wav, audio/x-wav 
and audio/wave in protocol info by do not accept auadio/Lxx (xx = sample size).
Was needed for Sonos to receive pcm samples. 
 - re-organize format detection code for wave header addition
 - suppress DIRECT mode (was useless)
 - correct some coredump on exit (access to invalid file handles)
