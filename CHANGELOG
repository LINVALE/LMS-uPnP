0.1.4.0
 - metadata request can cause a fault if the list has been emptied (mod 0 call)
 - if uPnP player cannot play a format, send the proper error code to LMS (also send STMc everytime)
 - add <flac_header> parameter
 - add <send_metadata> parameter

0.1.3.3 
 - with <seek_after_pause> set to 1, unpause was not restarting at the right time
if repositionig was done during pause
 - when upnp device capability for pcm does not detail sample rate and channel 
(ie audio/L16), add the channel and rate details in the mime-type response 
(ie audio/L16;channels=2;rate=44100) - was need for foobar2000
 - add aac in the supported format (does not seem to work with Sonos or foobar yet)
 - <volume_on_play> to 1 by default
 - <volume_curve> max by default is 65536 instead of 65535
 - check that squeezelite instance was created before trying to run it
 - L/R inversion corrected in PCM 24 bits, packed type 1
 - buffer write file opening done as soon as LMS play command is received (quick GET)
 - in flac metadata (for repositionning) vorbis header is needed to NamUniti
 - flac header in re-positioning was not set as "last block = 0x80" (happened after 
vorbis_comment was removed)
 - handle case where no playlist index is returned in metadata (crash)
 - metadata track and time request were doubling the '?'
 - add metadata 
 - change incorrect upnp:artist to dc:creator in DIDL string
 - change back flac header re-insertion default max block size to 0xfff
 - remove a few compiler warning
 - improve the "synchronous start" (continuous synchro does not work)

0.1.2.0
 - add a wav header to pcm stream for players that accept audio/wav, audio/x-wav 
and audio/wave in protocol info by do not accept audio/Lxx (xx = sample size).
Was needed for Sonos to receive pcm samples. Endianness pobably need more attention
 - re-organize format detection code for wave header addition
 - suppress DIRECT mode (was useless)
 - correct some coredump on exit (access to invalid file handles)
