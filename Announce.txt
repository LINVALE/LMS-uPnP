This is a re-announcement of the UPnP/DLNA to LMS bridge. For ease of use, I've now added a proper LMS plugin to the application itself, so it made sense to start a new thread

This plugin transforms UPnP/DLNA players found on your network into regular squeezeboxes (they appear as a squeezelite instance). 
You need to add this repository to your "Plugins" page
[CODE]http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26754471/squeezecenter/repo-stable.xml[/CODE]
and choose "UPnPBridge" 

It should provide pretty much all the features of squeezelite, except a few things
- synchronization does not work (at least don't use "keep synchronization during playback")
- crossfade is not available
- gapless only works if the UPnP player supports it

Once installed, there is a "UPnP/DLNA Bridge" page added to your "Settings" and you'll have to tweak probably a few parameters there. A list of pre-existing values is available as well, but your player is not include and you manage to have it working, please post here your successful configuration settings so that I can add them to the list of known devices
There is a complete guide that explains this application in details and goes through all the parameters, including the advanced ones that are not available from the LMS webpage. It can be found here (in the 'stable' section) together with all the source code

If should work for Windows, OSX, Linux x86 and ARM

I'd like to thank PasTim for his numerous contributions and ralphy for patches & builds !

Note1: if you have a "too many redirection" warning appearing when you add this repository, this is because dropbox wants an HTTPS connection and your LMS does not have io::socket::ssl library installed. I'll change the repository to somethign else in the future to solve that).
Note2: the port used for UPnP (49152 by default) must be open. Under Windows, you should have a popup (only the very first time the application is started) asking to allow squeeze2upnp-win to access your network.
