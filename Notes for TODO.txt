1- When <seek_after_pause> is set to 1 and when you press "unpause" in LMS, sq2u sends LMS a request to "seek" from the beginning to the "paused" time (this is equivalent to a "repositoning" done from the GUI)

2- Quobuz does not allow repositionning (you can try using a normal squeezebox player)

3- As a result, my "repositionning" request is ignored

4- Why only 1 pause allowed with flac ? I think I can see why as well : because LMS has this issue where it does not send a flac header after un-pause, sq2u have to rebuild a flac header on-the-fly, but in such "rebuilt" header, I cannot set the "total number of samples" to anything other than 0 (I don't know the size that LMS will send). 0 is a legitimate value in a flac header, but it means "total number of sample unknow". I guess that, when it sees that, the Uniti thinks that it is in front of a live stream (and all this only happens after the 2nd un-pause ...)

5- When the Uniti believes it is receiving a live stream, when pausing, it closes the connection and when un-pausing it re-opens it and asks for data starting from "first byte". For sq2u, "first byte" means from the beginning, but for the Uniti "first byte" means the most recent byte in the stream, as the stream is supposed to have continued during the pause - hence the "disconnect" between the two. Other players, like my Sonos, close the connection as well, but when they re-open it, they compute the last byte they received and ask sq2u to send data from there 

6- Why not on Spotify ? I guess (tbc) that Spotify allows "repositionning". In case thase, the command 1- and 3- work properly and it is the nature of LMS to rebuild entirely a stream that starts at the repositonned position. So in that precise case, the "first byte" of LMS/sq2u means the same "first byte" as understood by the Uniti
