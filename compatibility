Comments

Sonos:
 - it <buffer_size> is used, then pause/unpause will not work properly. This is
 due to the fact that Sonos does not accept -3 for <stream_length> and tries to
 re-read a track from the beginning on unpause, and this fails once the buffer has
 been shrunk once (see user guide)
 - <stream_length> at -3 does not work with mp3 files.

M1Cl1c:
 - Repositionning with flac does not work unless the flac-to-flac transcoding is
changed in LMS (see QUICKSTART)

Revo SuperConnect:
 - <stream_length> at -3 prevents proper pause as the Revo thinks that it is 
receiving a live stream and thus refuses to pause it (despite DLNA parameters
set to allow it to do so)

Windows Media Player:
 - WMP wants to acquire the whole stream before it starts playing - this takes a while
(similar comments as underneath ... compliance to standards)
 - pcm, although accepted by WMP, does not play

xBoxOne
 - Although the XBoxOne accept the upnp command SetNextAVTransportURI, it does not 
automatically move to that URI once the current URI finishes ... (it wants a "Next"
command). Microsoft, Microsoft I guess compliance to standards is good only for the 
others
