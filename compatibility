Comments

Sonos:
 - it <buffer_size> is used, then pause/unpause will not work properly. This is
 due to the fact that Sonos does not accept -3 for <stream_length> and tries to
 re-read a track from the beginning on unpause, and this fails once the buffer has
 been shrunk once (see user guide)

M1Cl1c:
 - Repositionning with flac does not work unless the flac-to-flac transcoding is
changed in LMS (see README in bin/ directory
