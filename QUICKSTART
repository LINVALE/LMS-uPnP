Simple guide in case (would be surprising) you don't want to RTFM

WINDOWS
	- copy squeeze2upnp is a directory
	- copy pthreadBC2.dll and cc32160mt.dll in the same directory

LINUX
	- copy squeeze2upnp-x86 in a directory
	- if your system is 64 bits, install 32 bits libraries : "sudo apt-get install libc6:i386"

- it DOES NOT NEED to run on the same machine than LMS (it can of course)

- Start the application at a command prompt or double-click on it, that all
and in many cases it will run fine

- If you want to change some configuration items, then it is time to RTFM, but 
here are a few quick tips before

1- to create a config file, launch squeeze2upnp and, WHILE IT IS RUNNING, 
type "save config.xml" (without the "")

2- a file named "config.xml" will be created in the directory where 
squeeze2upnp has be started from

3- There are a few parameters in this file you should worry about. Look 
at the COMPATIBILITY file for info on your player

<stream_length> : set it to 1000000000 if you have a Sonos system
<accept_nexturi> : set it to 0 if your player does not move to next track
<seek_after_pause> : set it to 1 if your player does not pause
<codecs> : set it to flc,mp3,pcm to support flac and pcm as well

4- last thing to know : these options can be set for all players or
for each player individually
